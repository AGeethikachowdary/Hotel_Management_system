Hotel management System is a technology that allows hotel operators and
owners to streamline their administrative tasks.
A database system built using PHP and MySQL that aims at replicating
the working of a hotel in real-life. It consists of different tables that would
be populated such as “room”, “roombook” which would contain information
on who has booked the room and how many rooms/what type of rooms
are available. It is integrated with a frontend to accept booking for various
kinds of rooms and is reflected appropriately in the backend(database)
